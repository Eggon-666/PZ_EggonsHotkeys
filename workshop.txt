title=Eggon's Hotkeys & Hot Actions
description=This mod introduces hotkeys for chosen actions requiring excessive clicking. No more of that frustration! All bindings can be changed/set in the game's [b]key bindings menu[/b]. Many actions are also accessible via ? Hot Actions and ? FlexKey!
description=? [b]Hot Actions[/b] allow you to trigger chosen actions from the context menu instead of a hotkey, because you know - keyboards have only so many keys... ;)
description=? [b]FlexKey[/b] - is a keybindig to which you can assign (also from context menu) action that you need at the moment. Chopping trees? Assign Chop trees. Opening storage units? Assign Sledgehammer. Cleaning the mayhem around your base? Assign Corpse Disposal. This way you can have the relevant option important for what you are doing at the moment and use just one key for many things!
description=
description=If you don't want HotActions and FlexKey to appear in your context menu, you can switch them off using [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2169435993]ModOptions[/url] mod.
